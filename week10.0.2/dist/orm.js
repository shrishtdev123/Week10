// problem with simple sql
//1. first probelm is that we have to write more raw sql which increase the complexcity to the programmere
//2.second problem is that migration is very hard from one shcema to other
//3. type saftey is not there in simple sql 
// so, to overcome these problem we should go for ORM(object relational mapping)
// prisma ,it provide
// 1. type saftey
// 2. we are not required to write the sql query expiciltly ,we have to write few line of code it automaticaly converted into raw sql behinde,we are not responsible to know
// 3. mingration is easy as compare to simple sql and done autimatically also it provide autocomplition .
// 4. prisma is replacment of pg in ORM
